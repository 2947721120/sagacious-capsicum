Feature: Rather than have clients keep a list of the endpoint URLs for
  gGRC-Core services, a service description document will be provided that
  lists the endpoints by name.

  Scenario: GET the service description for gGRC-CORE
    Given nothing new
    When GET of "/api" as "service_description"
    Then all expected endpoints are listed and GETtable in "service_description"
