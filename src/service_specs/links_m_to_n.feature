Feature: Many resources type pairs reference each other M x N relations. This 
  feature will exercise the cases where the linking between resources is M x N.

  Background:
    Given service description

  Scenario Outline:
    Given a new "<type_a>" named "resource_a"
    And "resource_a" is POSTed to its collection
    And a new "<type_b>" named "resource_b"
    And "resource_a" is added to links property "<link_property_b>" of "resource_b"
    And "resource_b" is POSTed to its collection
    When GET of the resource "resource_a"
    And GET of the resource "resource_b"
    Then the "<link_property_a>" property of the "resource_a" is not empty
    And "resource_b" is in the links property "<link_property_a>" of "resource_a"
    And the "<link_property_b>" property of the "resource_b" is not empty
    And "resource_a" is in the links property "<link_property_b>" of "resource_b"
    # Now, do it the reverse way
    Given a new "<type_b>" named "resource_b"
    And "resource_b" is POSTed to its collection
    Given a new "<type_a>" named "resource_a"
    And "resource_b" is added to links property "<link_property_a>" of "resource_a"
    And "resource_a" is POSTed to its collection
    When GET of the resource "resource_a"
    And GET of the resource "resource_b"
    Then the "<link_property_a>" property of the "resource_a" is not empty
    And "resource_b" is in the links property "<link_property_a>" of "resource_a"
    And the "<link_property_b>" property of the "resource_b" is not empty
    And "resource_a" is in the links property "<link_property_b>" of "resource_b"
